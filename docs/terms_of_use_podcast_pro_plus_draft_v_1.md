You may delete User Content from within the product where supported. Backups and logs may persist for a limited time consistent with our retention practices.

**AI limitations.** AI outputs can be inaccurate, incomplete, or inappropriate. You are responsible for reviewing outputs before publishing and for complying with applicable laws (including disclosures for AI-generated content where required).

## 6) Intellectual Property
The Service (including software, designs, interfaces, and documentation) and all related IP are owned by us and our licensors. Except for the limited rights expressly granted, we reserve all rights.

You may provide feedback or suggestions; you grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license to use them without restriction.

## 7) Copyright & DMCA
If you believe content on the Service infringes your copyright, you may submit a notice under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) to our agent:

- **DMCA Agent:** Scott Gerhardt
- **Address:** 121 W Lexington Dr Suite 236, Glendale, CA 91203
- **Email:** Scott@thebsgcompany.com

Your notice must include the information required by 17 U.S.C. Section 512(c)(3). We may notify the user who posted the material and provide a process for counter-notification where applicable.

## 8) Privacy
Your use of the Service is subject to our **[Privacy Policy URL]**, which explains how we collect, use, and share information. Where required by law (e.g., California, EU/UK), you may have certain rights over your personal data. Please review the Privacy Policy for details.

## 9) Disclaimers
THE SERVICE AND ALL OUTPUTS ARE PROVIDED **"AS IS"** AND **"AS AVAILABLE."** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE ERROR-FREE, UNINTERRUPTED, OR FREE OF HARMFUL COMPONENTS.

## 10) Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, **OUR TOTAL LIABILITY** FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICE **WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS YOU PAID TO US IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY** OR **$100** IF YOU HAVE NOT PAID ANY AMOUNTS. WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL.

## 12) Termination
You may stop using the Service at any time.

Upon termination, your right to use the Service ends, but certain sections (including IP, disclaimers, limitations, indemnities, and dispute provisions) will survive.

## 13) Changes to the Service or Terms
We may update the Service and these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will provide notice (e.g., by email or in-product). Changes take effect upon posting or as otherwise stated. Your continued use after changes become effective means you accept the updated Terms.

These Terms are governed by the laws of the **State of California**, without regard to its conflict of laws rules.

**Arbitration & Class Action Waiver.** Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service will be resolved by **binding arbitration** administered by the **American Arbitration Association (AAA)** under its **Consumer Arbitration Rules**, as modified by these Terms. Arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator in **Los Angeles County, California**, or remotely by video conference if the arbitrator permits. **You and we both waive any right to a jury trial and to participate in a class action, class arbitration, or representative proceeding.**

Either party may bring an individual action in **small claims court** in Los Angeles County, California, instead of arbitration. This Section does not prevent either party from seeking **injunctive or equitable relief** in a court of competent jurisdiction to protect intellectual property or prevent unauthorized use of the Service.

If any part of this Section is found unenforceable, the remainder will still apply, and the unenforceable part will be severed to the minimum extent necessary.

## 15) Export & Sanctions
You may not use or export the Service except as authorized by U.S. law and the laws of the jurisdiction(s) where the Service is provided. You represent you are not located in, under the control of, or a national/resident of any embargoed country or prohibited party list.

## 16) Communications
You consent to receive service-related communications electronically (e.g., emails, in-app messages). You may opt out of non-essential marketing emails.

## 17) Miscellaneous
If any provision is unenforceable, the remainder remains in effect. You may not assign these Terms without our prior written consent; we may assign them as part of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets. These Terms (plus any referenced policies) are the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Service and supersede prior agreements.
