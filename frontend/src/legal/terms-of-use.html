<p>Your notice must include the information required by 17 U.S.C. Section 512(c)(3). We may notify the user who posted the material and provide a process for counter-notification where applicable.</p>
<h2>8) Privacy</h2>
<p>Your use of the Service is subject to our <strong>[Privacy Policy URL]</strong>, which explains how we collect, use, and share information. Where required by law (e.g., California, EU/UK), you may have certain rights over your personal data. Please review the Privacy Policy for details.</p>
<h2>9) Disclaimers</h2>
<p>THE SERVICE AND ALL OUTPUTS ARE PROVIDED <strong>&quot;AS IS&quot;</strong> AND <strong>&quot;AS AVAILABLE.&quot;</strong> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE ERROR-FREE, UNINTERRUPTED, OR FREE OF HARMFUL COMPONENTS.</p>
<h2>10) Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, <strong>OUR TOTAL LIABILITY</strong> FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICE <strong>WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS YOU PAID TO US IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY</strong> OR <strong>$100</strong> IF YOU HAVE NOT PAID ANY AMOUNTS. WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations; in those cases, these limitations apply only to the extent permitted by law.</p>
<h2>11) Indemnification</h2>
<p>You will indemnify and hold us harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#39; fees) arising out of or related to: (a) your User Content; (b) your use of the Service; (c) your violation of these Terms; or (d) your violation of any law or third-party rights.</p>
<h2>12) Termination</h2>
<p>You may stop using the Service at any time. We may suspend or terminate your access immediately if you violate these Terms, create risk or possible legal exposure, fail to pay fees when due, or if we stop offering the Service. Upon termination, your right to use the Service ends, but certain sections (including IP, disclaimers, limitations, indemnities, and dispute provisions) will survive.</p>
<h2>13) Changes to the Service or Terms</h2>
<p>We may update the Service and these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will provide notice (e.g., by email or in-product). Changes take effect upon posting or as otherwise stated. Your continued use after changes become effective means you accept the updated Terms.</p>
<h2>14) Governing Law; Dispute Resolution</h2>
<p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the <strong>State of California</strong>, without regard to its conflict of laws rules.</p>
<p><strong>Arbitration &amp; Class Action Waiver.</strong> Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service will be resolved by <strong>binding arbitration</strong> administered by the <strong>American Arbitration Association (AAA)</strong> under its <strong>Consumer Arbitration Rules</strong>, as modified by these Terms. Arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator in <strong>Los Angeles County, California</strong>, or remotely by video conference if the arbitrator permits. <strong>You and we both waive any right to a jury trial and to participate in a class action, class arbitration, or representative proceeding.</strong></p>
<p>Either party may bring an individual action in <strong>small claims court</strong> in Los Angeles County, California, instead of arbitration. This Section does not prevent either party from seeking <strong>injunctive or equitable relief</strong> in a court of competent jurisdiction to protect intellectual property or prevent unauthorized use of the Service.</p>
<p>If any part of this Section is found unenforceable, the remainder will still apply, and the unenforceable part will be severed to the minimum extent necessary.</p>
<h2>15) Export &amp; Sanctions</h2>
<p>You may not use or export the Service except as authorized by U.S. law and the laws of the jurisdiction(s) where the Service is provided. You represent you are not located in, under the control of, or a national/resident of any embargoed country or prohibited party list.</p>
<h2>16) Communications</h2>
<p>You consent to receive service-related communications electronically (e.g., emails, in-app messages). You may opt out of non-essential marketing emails.</p>
<h2>17) Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>If any provision is unenforceable, the remainder remains in effect. You may not assign these Terms without our prior written consent; we may assign them as part of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets. These Terms (plus any referenced policies) are the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Service and supersede prior agreements.</p>
