    <description>Movies give us countless scenarios and situations the characters have to navigate. Well, how would YOU handle these situations in you were in their place? Amber, Scott and the occasional guest tackle this very topic. We're not a review show, but there are enough opinions between us you'll get a little of that too. We mostly try to keep it lighthearted and funny. Sometimes we succeed, sometimes not so much, but it's usually entertaining nonetheless.</description>

When a young girl's father gets abducted by aliens and replaced with someone else, our hosts dive into the age-old question: what's worse, losing your dad to extraterrestrials or having to explain that to your therapist later? Swedish alien hunters are apparently on display, because nothing says 'credible UFO investigation' quite like Nordic efficiency. Grab your tinfoil hat and your skepticism - you'll need both for this close encounter.</description>

      <description>mber and Scott dive into the uncomfortable truth about adult friendships with a film that's basically a masterclass in social awkwardness. As they discuss, if you don't have friends by the time you're an adult, you're probably screwed - but this movie suggests that making new ones might be even worse. When suburban dad Craig's attempts to make an adult male friend spiral completely out of control, our hosts explore why friendship as a grown-up is such a real challenge. Sometimes you take what you can get, but don't be too weird about it - because as this film shows, it can be easy come, easy go.</description>

      <itunes:title>E147 - Fight or Flight - What Would YOU Do?</itunes:title>
      <description>Amber and Scott tackle an airplane battle royale mashup that somehow manages to cram assassins, flight attendants, and tech bros into one gloriously chaotic action-comedy. Because nothing says 'relaxing flight' quite like a plane full of killers with questionable weapon-smuggling skills and even more questionable survival instincts. Our hosts dive into the important questions: How exactly did all these assassins get weapons on board, and why does every airplane movie seem to think there's a service elevator at 30,000 feet? Buckle up for this high-altitude discussion that's more turbulent than the movie itself.</description>

      <description>Amber and Scott are up for some reject superheroes after diving into Marvel's latest team of misfits who probably got kicked out of the good superhero groups for a reason. That mysterious asterisk in the title remains unexplained because, as our hosts admit, it didn't come up - but hey, at least someone had to type it. This week they're exploring what happens when you take all the B-list heroes and villains and throw them together, probably hoping they'll figure out how to save the world without destroying it first. Spoiler alert: the jury's still out on that one.</description>

      <description>Amber and Scott discuss The Surfer, where Nicholas Cage is full-on Nicholas Caging harder than ever - and yes, it's exactly what you probably think. When a man returns to his beachside hometown in Australia and gets humiliated by local surfers claiming ownership over the beach, things escalate wildly out of control in true Cage fashion. Our hosts explore what happens when childhood wounds, territorial surfers, and peak Nicolas Cage energy collide at the edge of sanity. What the hell was that? Even they're not entirely sure, but that's half the fun.</description>

      <description>Amber and Scott take on a very real and unflinching look at modern warfare through the eyes of soldiers who lived it, because sometimes the most important stories are the ones that make us the most uncomfortable. Written and directed by Iraq War veteran Jay Mendoza and Alex Garland, this film embeds audiences with a platoon of American Navy SEALs in an Iraqi family's home during a real-time operation. Our hosts grapple with putting themselves in the shoes of those who've experienced the unthinkable, exploring how war is hell and probably even worse than most of us can imagine. This isn't your typical action movie - it's a visceral, boots-on-the-ground story told like never before.</description>

      <description>Special guest Jimmy joins Amber and Scott to tackle a horror film that asks the ultimate question: are you scared of dying, especially if you knew you'd just restart the night a little more screwed up than before? When a group finds themselves stalked by a masked killer and horrifically murdered one by one, only to wake up back at the beginning of the same evening, our hosts explore the psychological nightmare of being trapped in a deadly time loop. Jimmy adds his unique perspective as they discuss what happens when your worst night becomes your eternal night. Sometimes the real horror isn't dying - it's having to live through the same terror indefinitely until you're too broken to continue.</description>

      <description>Amber and Scott discover that death and technology don't mix particularly well after watching a film about a tech entrepreneur who's developed software that lets the bereaved witness their loved ones' decomposition process. Because apparently, someone thought what grief really needed was a live stream of decay with premium subscription features. Our hosts dive into this premise that had so much potential but was executed about as well as the people being monitored. When you have lots of money, tech skills, and a bit of creepiness, this is apparently how you handle loss - and it's exactly as disturbing as it sounds.</description>

When trying to get pregnant, accidentally getting pregnant, and doing this within the context of gay couples creates one really messed up situation, our hosts explore how love, immigration, and family expectations can create the most beautifully chaotic scenarios. Sometimes the best families are the ones you choose, even when those choices involve green card marriages, commitment-phobic boyfriends, and surprise pregnancies that nobody saw coming.</description>

Okay, maybe not exactly that, but you get the picture as they dive into a fantasy adventure that involves a lot of CGI special effects and creatures known as the Ochi.

Sometimes the real legend is how a movie manages to be both epic and ridiculous at the same time.&quot;</description>

      <itunes:title>E133 - The Luckiest Man in America - What Would YOU Do?</itunes:title>
      <description>Amber and Scott dive into the compelling true story of the infamous Michael Larson, who figured out how to game the Press Your Luck game show in 1984 with a number of ridiculous things thrown in along the way. When someone discovers the patterns behind what's supposed to be random and turns it into the ultimate winning strategy, our hosts explore whether he was brilliant or just incredibly observant. Sometimes the luckiest man in America isn't lucky at all - he's just smart enough to see what everyone else missed.</description>

      <description>Amber and Scott discuss what happens when a family accidentally kills a unicorn during a road trip and decides to bring it to a billionaire's party, because apparently that's a normal response to mythical creature vehicular manslaughter. When magical realism meets dark comedy and wealthy people's parties get weird, our hosts explore how far people will go to turn tragedy into opportunity. Sometimes the most unbelievable part isn't the unicorn - it's what people are willing to do with it.</description>

      <description>On this episode of Cinema IRL, the hosts dissect the horror-comedy Heart Eyes, a film where a fake kiss unfortunately gets two coworkers placed on a Valentine's Day killer's hit list. This leads to a hilarious roast of the characters' bafflingly poor choices, from their questionable escape tactics to complaining about being &quot;ditched&quot; mid-chase. The hosts even find themselves rooting for the killer to dispatch one particularly obnoxious couple, proving that sometimes the most horrifying part of a movie is the characters themselves.</description>

      <description>On their podcast &quot;Cinema IRL,&quot; the hosts tackle the thriller &quot;Flight Risk,&quot; where an air marshal's simple prisoner transport becomes a nightmare when the pilot is revealed to be a henchman. This prompts a spirited debate on the proper sky-high protocol for when you have one too many bad guys on your plane. Between questioning the logistics of stabbing-related first aid and one host's deep suspicion of a suspiciously charming radio pilot, the episode is a masterclass in cinematic second-guessing.</description>

The movie review takes a sharp turn into reality when one of the hosts reveals he has a startlingly similar backstory of homelessness and teacher intervention. It’s a heartfelt look at the life-changing power of empathy that quickly becomes a game of &quot;wait, this actually happened to you?&quot;.</description>

      <description>The Cinema IRL podcast tackles &quot;Presence,&quot; a film billed as the year's scariest, but the hosts were more confused than terrified. The big supernatural mystery turns out to be a baffling combination of a regular &quot;punk kid&quot; villain and the brother's protective spirit from the future. The movie was so unscary that the hosts shared their own spooky encounters, which were less &quot;The Conjuring&quot; and more &quot;The Case of the Mysterious Backyard Beer Cans.&quot;</description>

      <description>What happens when the rent money gets spent on a questionable t-shirt business? The Cinema IRL podcast breaks down &quot;One of Them Days,&quot; a film where best friends Drew and Alisa embark on a frantic, chaotic scramble to avoid eviction. Their day spirals into a series of hilariously poor decisions, including selling blood and accidentally stealing from a local gangster. Ultimately, their evicted belongings become an impromptu, and surprisingly successful, pop-up art show, proving that sometimes hitting rock bottom comes with a creative twist.</description>
